## Unit Test
Unit tests are the testing of individual classes or individual class's functionality. Unit tests may include other classes, but we are only testing the functionality of the class in question. I also included component integration tests or orchestration classes under the unit tests umbrella as long as it does not connect to an API, database, or the file system (integration tests).
